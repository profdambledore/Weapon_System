# Weapon_System
 

A Destiny 2 inspired Weapon and Perk system created in Unreal Engine 4

Project Support Document:

As an avide player of the Destiny series for the last 6+ years, Destiny 2 has one of the best weapon systems of any modern game, not just in the looter shooter.  While allowing for player creativity and build crafting, the limitations of the system keep the game in balance while having over the 100~ different weapons available.

In this project, I research how Bungie utilises a plug-and-socket system, different weapon buckets, perk triggers and more, then follow my research by creating a similar system in Unreal Engine 4, primarily in C++.
